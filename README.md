*v0.3*                                                    
This first iteration of the project implements seek, flee, obstacle separation and avoidance between agents.                                                
Priorities are also included, and you can modify them to change the AI behaviour.

*How it works:*                                                                                      
Move the central square with WASD. For now, it will be the target where agents will move towards (or evade).
