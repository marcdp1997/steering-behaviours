### Implemented steering:                                                                                                                                    
Arrive, seek, flee, pursuit, evade, wander, obstacle avoidance, separation between agents and queue.                                                

### How it works:                                              
In these project there are 3 scenes for now:
1) **HunterPrey**: A hunter is trying to catch some preys. If he gets too close they will evade him.                                       
   _Steerings used: wander, pursuit, evade and separation._
2) **CustomerQueue**: Some agents will try to go through a small corridor.                           
   _Steerings used: arrive, separation, avoidance and queue._
3) **PursuitWithObstacles**: Move the central square with WASD, it will be the target for these pursuers.                            
   _Steerings used: pursuit, separation and avoidance._
