*Implemented steering:*                                                                                                                                     
This first iteration of the project implements seek, flee, pursue, evade, wander, obstacle separation and avoidance between agents.                                                
Priorities are also included, and you can modify them to change the AI behaviour.

*How it works:*                                                                                      
Move the central square with WASD. For now, it will be the target for the agents.
